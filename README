Clojure wrapper for the jsch SSH Library.

For the legal stuff please see LICENSE.

== What does it do ==

Clossher is a wrapper for the jsch SSH library, it allows to used most of the
SSH functions. It can execute code on a remote host, copy files forth and back
or open shell sessions - to allow executing multiple commands in a session that
'remember' their state (usefull for using su or things that require
interaction).

== Nice to know ==

Since the underlaying jsch library is native java code clossher will work
entirely platform indipendant.

== Requirements ==

You will need the jsch jar file, currently this is tested with version 0.1.42.
The jar file can be fetched from: http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/. Most of the
credit should go there, the wrapper just makes it nice and clojureish, trying to
hide most of the javaness in the SSH stuff.

== Known issues ==

* Using exec after working with a shell-session does not work well.
* sftp does not work with directories, sorry it seems to be a limitation of the
  underlaying library, but I'm thinking about a workaround.

== Last words ==
